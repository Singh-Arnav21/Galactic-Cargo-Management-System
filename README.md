# Galactic Cargo Management System

I implemented Nested AVL tree as a part of an assignment in **Data Structures and Algorithms** course at **IIT Delhi**.

In this assignment, we had to build a Cargo Management System to efficiently put objects in cargo bins.

Different type of objects (distinguished by color) are assigned to different bins using various bin-packing algorithms such as Compact Fit and Largest Fit.
